# Portfolio-Optimisation for the Defensive Investor

For a few selected stocks we will see how the weights allocation for each stock differs for different investment strategies and 
compare the returns for those strategies.

For the stock selection strategy I've used P/E ratio and selected multiple stocks from different cap categories - Bluechip, midcap and 
smallcap of varied P/E ratio to see how the weights allocation varies for each stock. As for the portfolio creation I've used
two approaches. 

  #1.Monte Carlo Simulation. The code for this approach is taken from "https://towardsdatascience.com/efficient-frontier-portfolio-optimisation-in-python-e7844051e7f"

  #2.Python optimization library 'pyportfolioopt' which uses Sharpe Ratio as the Objective function to optimise the weights
